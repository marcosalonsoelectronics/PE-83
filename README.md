Material of video PE-83: Off-Time Current Control of DC-DC Converters

Available at: https://youtu.be/va1SSHtXvLs

This video investigates the off-time current control of dc-dc converters. The important equations are presented. The behavior of the buck converter under off-time current control is highlighted. The implementation of the control circuit is shown in detail. Simulation results using Qspice are also presented.
